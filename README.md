To run the provided code successfully, you need to follow these steps to set up the necessary documents and prerequisites:

Python Environment:
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.
Install the required packages. In this case, the code uses Selenium and PyAutoGUI, which are not part of the standard library. Install them using pip:

```pip install selenium pyautogui```

Chrome WebDriver:

You need to download the Chrome WebDriver (compatible with your installed Chrome browser version) from the official Selenium website (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in a location accessible by the Python script. The WebDriver allows Selenium to interact with the Chrome browser.
CSV File:

Prepare a CSV file containing phone numbers with or without specified names. The CSV file should have two columns: one for the name and the other for the phone number.
If using random names, the CSV file should contain only phone numbers in the second column.
If using specified names, the CSV file should contain both the name and the phone number.
WhatsApp Web Setup:

Before running the code, open WhatsApp Web (https://web.whatsapp.com/) on your computer and log in using your WhatsApp account. This is necessary to access the WhatsApp chats.
Code Modification (Optional):

The code provided has hardcoded values, like the filename "contacts.vcf" and other XPATHs specific to WhatsApp Web. If you need to change these values, you can do so in the code as required.
Run the Code:

Now, run the Python script. You should be prompted to select the CSV file that contains the phone numbers and names.
The script will then create a "contacts.vcf" file based on the provided CSV data, which will be used to add contacts to the selected WhatsApp group.
Follow Guidelines:

After running the script, you will be presented with a GUI window asking you to follow the guidelines.
On your mobile device, open the WhatsApp personal messages and save all the contacts received as a VCF file.
Once you've followed the guidelines and completed the task on your mobile device, click the "After Done Click here!!!" button in the GUI window.
The Script Execution:

The script will now proceed to add contacts to the specified WhatsApp group, as per the provided CSV data.
Please ensure you carefully review the code and understand its implications before running it. It involves interacting with WhatsApp Web and automating tasks, which should be used responsibly and with proper consent. Also, remember to comply with WhatsApp's Terms of Service and avoid any activity that may violate their policies.
